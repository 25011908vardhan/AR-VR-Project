# AR-VR-Project

  In a world, where it has become so easy to obtain the right to
drive via illegal practice, it has become important for us to
educate people about the various road regulations. It
includes having knowledge about the various road signals,
and the intricacies of driving a vehicle.<br>
  It is different from the usual driving games, because our
simulation does not award the user for rash driving.<br>
  Instead it teaches them about various road signs.<br>
